        I know, we’ve all been there… One day motivation kicked in, and we
        bought 10 of those daily planner notebooks, swearing to live each day to
        the fullest and make the world a better place… Only to find that all of
        the plans were “unintentionally archived” and the notebooks all
        “prematurely retired”. Well, worry no more. My-Todo is built to help you
        organize your tasks in an orderly manner. Instantly accessible with no
        downloads and no plug-ins, you can easily log your to-dos into the
        calendar and keep track of your daily progress. Since there is no way to
        decommission the web, it might as well just be a good idea to stick to
        the plan, and, you know, see what will happen :)
